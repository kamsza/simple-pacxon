# Simple PAC-XON

This repository contains python code, that allows you to mark chosen area using ***scipy*** and ***numby*** packages. This model is used in [PAC-XON](https://github.com/kamsza/pacxon) game.

**How does it works:**
* you can place a green circle in a tile by clicking on it,
* you can move yellow circle with arrows on keyboard,
* yellow circle will move utill it reaches some blue tile,
* the area is marked only if it is surrounded by blue tiles and there is no green circel inside,
